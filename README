NAME
    YouTube™ Bookmark Cleaner - Find bookmarks that link to removed YouTube™ videos

DESCRIPTION
    Search your bookmarks for YouTube™ videos that are removed or unavailable
    due to copyright disputes, account termination, etc. While other bookmark
    cleaners work well for finding broken links and duplicates, they do not
    work on YouTube™ videos because they always return successful HTTP status
    codes, even when the video has been deleted. This Chrome extension fills
    that gap by verifying the status of each video using the YouTube™ Data API.
